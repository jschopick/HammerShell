Epic:
As a couple of CS 100 students, we should create a program that creates executables to parse
through commands in order to create an rshell.
- Use RPN to create a stack of the connectors and commands
- Use boolean executes to determine whether each class function is true to parse through the text
- Create a test class to test each function
- Test the functionality further using scripts to create specific test cases with each class
